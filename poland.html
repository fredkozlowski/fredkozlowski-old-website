		      <h1>Poland in WW2</h1>
		<p style = "color:black;">
				
			<p>I dislike how the general perception of Poland in WW2 is that it was steamrolled by Germany and the USSR and then proceeded to not play a role after that. Wikipedia used as source</p>

		      <h1>Invasion of Poland</h1>
		      
		      <p>Poland was invaded on September 1 1939 by Germany and the Soviet Union on September 17 1939. The invasion ended on 6 October, meaning that Poland lasted 1 month and 5 days. Please compare to the Invasion of France, which had ~ 150 divisions on both sides facing off, and France only fighting on one front. The French lasted 46 days. Meanwhile Poland was outnumbered 2:1 and facing invasion on both sides. In addition to this, the air force was tiny, they had almost no navy and a few early 1930s tanks. Despite this clear difference, both Poland and France suffered almost 3x the casualties of the Germans/Soviets during their respective invasions. Remember that France was considered to have the strongest military in the world in 1939! Poland ended up destroying 25% of the German Air Force, and 1000 tanks. </p>
		      
		      <p>The actual beginning of the war was when a German battleship “visited” the port city of Gdansk on a “courtesy call” and then opened fire on an ammunition depot. The Germans had also brought ~250 men to take the ammunition depot from the ground. Meanwhile the Poles had ~210 men. The Germans thought they could take the depot in, “a matter of hours,” whereas the Poles held for a whole week. In addition to this, the small garrison tied up 3000 German soldiers. When the Poles finally surrendered because they ran out of ammo, the Germans stood at attention and allowed the commanding officer to keep his saber.</p>
		      
		      <p>Despite what you may have learned, Polish cavalry never charged at tanks because they aren’t brain dead. It was Nazi propaganda. What actually happened was that 250 Polish cavalrymen charged and successfully dispersed a German infantry regiment of 800 men. This terrified the German divisional command so much that they considered a retreat. Only the personal intervention of Heinz Guderian kept the unit in place. The myth comes from when a German tank unit later massacred the cavalrymen during a retreat.</p>
		      
		      <h1>Occupied Poland</h1>
		      
		      <p>Poland, unlike many nations such as France or Norway, never surrendered to the Germans. The remaining members of government evacuated to Britain to continue the legacy of an independent Poland. In addition to this, Poland never had a collaborationist government. This is where the occupying force (Germany) sets up a government that is run nominally by the original people (Poles) but is really just a puppet government. See Vichy France, Quisling. Quote from Wikipedia, “The Germans had initially considered the creation of a collaborationist Polish cabinet to administer, as a protectorate, the occupied Polish territories that had not been annexed outright into the Third Reich. At the beginning of the war German officials contacted several Polish leaders with proposals for collaboration, but they all refused.” Historians also estimate that about 5% of Poles collaborated with the Germans, and this includes the substantial German minority that lived in Poland before the war. Compare to the 25% that actively opposed German rule.</p>
		      
		      <p>Poland’s great contribution to speeding up the end of WW2 was in the field of intelligence. Poland actually cracked the Enigma, despite all that bullshit you hear about Alan Turing. What Alan Turing achieved was that he cracked a slightly more complex version of the Enigma which was developed later in the war. He couldn’t have done this without the foundational work of Polish mathematicians. Poles also managed to steal crucial parts of the V2 rocket in 1941, which allowed for better Allied air defense against the rockets. Poles ran the largest intelligence network in Nazi Germany. 43% of intelligence reports in Europe came from Polish spies. As early as 1940 Polish spies had sent information to the British government about concentration camps.</p>

		      <p>Poles did also fight in many major battles during WW2, despite only having small amounts of soldiers escape to the West. Polish fighter pilots that escaped to Britain made up 5% of the total fighter pilot population yet were responsible for 12% of kills. "Had it not been for the magnificent material contributed by the Polish squadrons and their unsurpassed gallantry," wrote Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, head of RAF Fighter Command, "I hesitate to say that the outcome of the Battle (of Britain) would have been the same." Polish squadron 303 was the most effective fighter squadron in the British Air Force. About 4000 sailors escaped with their ships to Britain where they helped sink the Bismarck and escorted convoys. Polish ground troops were also present at many major battles, and were instrumental in taking Monte Cassino, participated in Operation Market Garden. 
		      </p>
		      
		      <p>The Soviets invaded Poland and took a lot of the Polish Army prisoner. When the Germans invaded they were offered the opportunity to create their own army under Soviet control. The Berling Army as it was called consisted of 200,000 men, who fought from Lvov to Berlin.</p>
		      
		      <h1>Polish Resistance</h1>
		      
		      <p>The Polish Resistance was not so much a resistance movement, but a legitimate army loyal to the Government-In-Exile. The strength of the Home Army, as it was called, was 400,000, making this the largest resistance movement in Europe. Compare this to the French Resistance, which is so popular in Western media, which numbered 40,000. 90% of the French population was not involved in resistance, and as a historian noted, "Yet perhaps the most striking testimony to the extent of denunciation came from the Germans themselves, surprised at how ready the French were to betray each other."</p>
		      
		      <p>Here are some figures for what the Polish Resistance achieved. </p>
		      
		      <br><img src="img/damage.png" alt="Image" class="center"><br>
		      
		      <p>How many German troops were forced to be stationed in Poland to keep the peace.</p>
		      
		      <br><img src="img/wehrmacht.png" alt="Image" class="center"><br>
		      
		      <p>Meanwhile estimates for how many Germans the French Resistance killed are about 2,000 Germans. Poles killed an estimated 150,000. The Polish Home Army held full scale battles against German forces in 1943 and 1944. The biggest operation of the war was when the Polish Resistance actually retook parts of the capital Warsaw, with around 20,000-50,000 people, 2,500 of which actually had weapons. This happened while Soviet troops were on the other side of the river from Warsaw, who the Poles had hoped would support them. Stalin ordered his troops to hold and allow the Germans to murder the Poles so that the Resistance wouldn’t cause problems for the Soviets occupation later. In return, the Germans massacred 200,000 people and fully destroyed 85% of the city. Quote from Heinrich Himmler, “This is the fiercest of our battles since the start of the war. It compares to the street battles of Stalingrad.” The resistance lasted 63 days. What the city looked like in 1950. </p>

		      <h1>Holocaust</h1>
		      
		      <p>Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe pre-war, approximately 10% of the total population. The reason for this was because Poland was the most tolerant nation towards Jews before the war. “ Between the end of the Polish–Soviet War of 1919 and late 1938, the Jewish population of the Republic grew by nearly half a million, or over 464,000 persons. Jews preferred to live in relatively tolerant Poland rather than in the USSR, and continued to integrate, to marry into Polish Gentile families, to bring them into their community through marriage, to feel Polish and to form an important part of Polish society.” Meanwhile...</p>
		      
		      <p>France</p>
		      <p> "I feel myself very friendly to Hitler, and to all Germans, whom I feel to be my brothers … Our real enemies are Jews and Masons", and "Yids are like bedbugs." By 1937 even mainstream French conservatives and socialists, not previously associated with antisemitism, denounced the alleged Jewish influence pushing the country into a "Jewish war" against Nazi Germany. The new intensity of anti-Semitism facilitated the extremism of the Vichy regime after 1940.</p>
		      
		      <p>Great Britain</p>
		      <p>Consistent with its complex history, Britain was not particularly receptive to Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi regime in Germany, and the other fascist states of Europe. Approximately 40,000 Jews from Austria and Germany were eventually allowed to settle in Britain before the War, in addition to 50,000 Jews from Italy, Poland, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Despite the increasingly dire warnings coming from Germany, at the Evian Conference of 1938, Britain refused to allow further Jewish refugees into the country.</p>
		      
		      <p>The United States of America</p>
		      <p>Antisemitism in the United States was also indicated by national public opinion polls taken from the mid nineteen thirties to the late nineteen forties. The results showed that over half the American population saw Jews as greedy and dishonest. These polls also found that many Americans believed that Jews were too powerful in the United States. Similar polls were also taken, one of which posed that 35–40 percent of the population was prepared to accept an anti-Jewish campaign.</p>
		      <p>In a 1938 poll, approximately 60 percent of the respondents held a low opinion of Jews, labeling them "greedy," "dishonest," and "pushy."[24] 41 percent of respondents agreed that Jews had "too much power in the United States," and this figure rose to 58 percent by 1945. In 1939 a Roper poll found that only thirty-nine percent of Americans felt that Jews should be treated like other people. Fifty-three percent believed that "Jews are different and should be restricted" and ten percent believed that Jews should be deported. Several surveys taken from 1940 to 1946 found that Jews were seen as a greater threat to the welfare of the United States than any other national, religious, or racial group.</p>
		      
		      <p>According to David Wyman, "The United States and its Allies were willing to attempt almost nothing to save the Jews.”</p>
		      
		      <p>The SS St. Louis sailed out of Hamburg into the Atlantic Ocean in May 1939 carrying one non-Jewish and 936 (mainly German) Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution just before World War II.

On 4 June 1939, having failed to obtain permission to disembark passengers in Cuba, the St. Louis was also refused permission to unload on orders of President Roosevelt as the ship waited in the Caribbean Sea between Florida and Cuba. Initially, Roosevelt showed limited willingness to take in some of those on board despite the Immigration Act of 1924, but vehement opposition came from Roosevelt's Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, and from Southern Democrats—some of whom went so far as to threaten to withhold their support of Roosevelt in the 1940 Presidential election if this occurred.</p>
		      
		      <p>In 1944, a public opinion poll showed that a quarter of Americans still regarded Jews as a "menace."</p>
		      
		      <p>It has been estimated that 190,000–200,000 Jews could have been saved during the Second World War had it not been for bureaucratic obstacles to immigration deliberately created by Breckinridge Long and others.</p>
		      
		      <p>Poland, however, was the one nation where helping Jews did not only get you killed, but also your entire family would be murdered and then your home would be burned down.</p>
		      
		      <p>Israel keeps a list of Righteous Among the Nations, for saving Jews from extermination during the Holocaust. Poles make up ¼ of the whole list, more than any other nation. Despite the average Pole only receiving a food ration of 670 calories a day, many still found ways to feed Jews in the ghettos. Polish Resistance also helped Jews organize armed resistance against the Germans.</p>
		      
		      <p>I don't say this to whitewash Poland as some pro-Jewish paradise pre-war, but just to point out that Poland was at most as anti-Semitic as other European nations.</p>
		      
		      <p>One particularly striking example was a Polish cavalry officer and intelligence agent who willingly went to Auschwitz to report conditions in 1941. He smuggled in food and a radio through which he notified the British about how many were dying. He organized a resistance movement there, escaped with others in 1943 and then took part in the Warsaw Uprising. He was then executed by the Communists in 1948.</p>
		      
		      <h1>Polish Resistance to Communism</h1>
		      
		      <p>Many Poles continued to fight against Communism. Churchill and Stalin had agreed for Poland to not become an independent state, reneging on previous promises. Polish soldiers were not allowed to participate in the Victory Parade in London. Stalin went on to murder 20,000 people.

The last anti-Communist guerilla died in 1963, after 24 years of fighting against the Germans and Russians. Apparently up to 200 civilians were involved in helping him survive against the Communist police, despite threats of imprisonment.</p>
